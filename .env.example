# Mock Data Fallback
# Set to "true" to use mock data when API fails (useful for development/testing)
# In production, this should be "false" or omitted to show proper error states
VITE_USE_MOCK_FALLBACK=false

# Note: No API keys are required!
# - EuroLeague/EuroCup data comes from the free official EuroLeague API
# - Super League Basketball uses mock data (no public API available)
